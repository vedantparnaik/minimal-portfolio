# Work Experience
**Software Engineer Assistant @ University at Buffalo, SUNY <br> (_August 2024 - Present_)**
- Designed a neural network combining convolutional layers for feature extraction, and LSTMs for temporal analysis, achieving 72% accuracy in predicting the stage of Parkinson.
- Created a structured dataset from 15 diverse tests, integrating data from the National Institute of Health, USC.
- Developed personalized treatment plans, leveraging insights from model predictions and integrating SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) for transparency in decision-making.

**Software Engineer Intern @ India FIRSTRobotics, India <br> (_August 2019 - April 2020_)**
- **Military UTV to detect landmines:** Worked on designing a UTV on NVIDIA Jetson with mine detection sensor, IMU, GPS, and LiDAR for navigation and mark location with 0.5-meter precision.
- Implemented [Image segmentation and depth estimation](https://github.com/vedantparnaik/Image-Segmentation-Depth-Estimation-for-UTV) on the UTV using the KITTI dataset, achieving 2-meter accuracy and establishing spatial relationships for real-time navigation and obstacle avoidance.
- **Two-wheel Self-balancing Robot:** Developed software systems for a prototype of EvoBOT for grasping, carrying tasks, and path traversal on slopes, rough terrains, and slippery surfaces.
