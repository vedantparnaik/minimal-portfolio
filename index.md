# Work Experience
**Software Engineer Assistant @ University at Buffalo (_August 2024 - Present_)**
- Designed a neural network combining convolutional layers for feature extraction, and LSTMs for temporal analysis, achieving 72% accuracy in predicting the stage of Parkinson.
- Created a structured dataset from 15 diverse tests, integrating data from the National Institute of Health, USC.
- Developed personalized treatment plans, leveraging insights from model predictions and integrating SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) for transparency in decision-making.

**Software Engineer Intern @ India FIRSTRobotics (_August 2019 - April 2020_)**
- **Military UTV to detect landmines:** Worked on designing a UTV on NVIDIA Jetson with mine detection sensor, IMU, GPS, and LiDAR for navigation and mark location with 0.5-meter precision.
- Implemented [Image segmentation and depth estimation](https://github.com/vedantparnaik/Image-Segmentation-Depth-Estimation-for-UTV) on the UTV using the KITTI dataset, achieving 2-meter accuracy and establishing spatial relationships for real-time navigation and obstacle avoidance.
- **Two-wheel Self-balancing Robot:** Developed software systems for a prototype of EvoBOT for grasping, carrying tasks, and path traversal on slopes, rough terrains, and slippery surfaces.

# Projects 

### ASL (American Sign Language) Fingerspelling Recognition - GOOGLE Competition

[![View on GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-View_on_GitHub-blue?logo=GitHub)](https://github.com/vedantparnaik/ASL-American-Sign-Language-Fingerspelling-Recognition)

<div style="text-align: justify">The release of Google's BERT is described as the beginning of a new era in NLP. In this notebook I'll use the HuggingFace's transformers library to fine-tune pretrained BERT model for a classification task. Then I will compare BERT's performance with a baseline model, in which I use a TF-IDF vectorizer and a Naive Bayes classifier. The transformers library helps us quickly and efficiently fine-tune the state-of-the-art BERT model and yield an accuracy rate 10% higher than the baseline model.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify">First I build co-occurence matrices of ingredients from Facebook posts from 2011 to 2015. Then, to identify interesting and rare ingredient combinations that occur more than by chance, I calculate Lift and PPMI metrics. Lastly, I plot time-series data of identified trends to validate my findings. Interesting food trends have emerged from this analysis.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify">In order to predict whether a message is spam, first I vectorized text messages into a format that machine learning algorithms can understand using Bag-of-Word and TF-IDF. Then I trained a machine learning model to learn to discriminate between normal and spam messages. Finally, with the trained model, I classified unlabel messages into normal or spam.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify">In this project I am going to perform comprehensive EDA on the breast cancer dataset, then transform the data using Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and use Support Vector Machine (SVM) model to predict whether a patient has breast cancer.</div>
