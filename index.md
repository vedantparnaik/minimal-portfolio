# Work Experience
**Research Assistant @ University at Buffalo, SUNY <br> (_August 2024 - Present_)**
- Designed a neural network combining convolutional layers for feature extraction, and LSTMs for temporal analysis, achieving 72% accuracy in predicting the stage of Parkinson.
- Created a structured dataset from 15 diverse tests, integrating data from the National Institute of Health, USC.
- Developed personalized treatment plans, leveraging insights from model predictions and integrating SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) for transparency in decision-making.

**Software Engineer Intern @ India FIRSTRobotics, India <br> (_August 2019 - April 2020_)**
- **Autonomous UTV for Landmine Detection:** Worked on designing a UTV on NVIDIA Jetson with mine detection sensor, IMU, GPS, and LiDAR for navigation and marking location with 0.5-meter precision.
- Implemented <a href="https://github.com/vedantparnaik/Image-Segmentation-Depth-Estimation-for-UTV" target="_blank">
  Image Segmentation and Depth Estimation
</a> on the UTV using the KITTI dataset, achieving 2-meter accuracy in establishing spatial relationships for real-time navigation and obstacle avoidance.
- **Two-wheel Self-balancing Robot:** Developed software systems for a prototype of <a href="https://www.iml.fraunhofer.de/en/fields_of_activity/material-flow-systems/iot-and-embedded-systems/evobot.html" target="_blank"> EvoBOT </a> for grasping, carrying tasks, and path traversal on slopes, rough terrains, and slippery surfaces.

# Guest Lecture

#### _AI in Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, Spring '24_

Recently, I had the opportunity to deliver a guest lecture at Pune University, India on "AI in Medicine and Biomedical Sciences," and I shared my journey of working on tools like disease prediction systems for Parkinson’s and enhancing medical devices with AI. <br> For me, it’s all about using technology to empower doctors and improve patient care in meaningful ways.
